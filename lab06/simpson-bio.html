                My major is information management and technology. 
                I declared this major during the spring semester of sophomore year. 
                I've already taken a bunch of classes in this major and have throughly enjoyed them.

                My interests in this major are administrating/creating databases for the cannabis industry. 
                I have a minor in cannabis studies that I have completed, and also have a passion for working in the industry one day. 
                The cannabis industry, like any industry, runs on data. Since it's so new I see it as a great opportunity to start my own business or work with a startup.

                I worked at a real estate company this past summer doing data engineering. The company was called Lightstone. It was an amazing experience. 
                I learned a lot about data analytics and database management. I worked with the real estate company and the reinsurance company, which is a branch off the real estate company. 
                I feel a lot more comfortable navigating technology after this internship.

                I worked at a cannabis company, Columbia Care, two summers ago doing HR. This was a great way to get my foot in the door in the industry. 
                HR is not something I am interested in doing in the future, but it really helps with learning about all the different positions, and what they do at a cannabis company.

                I am the President of my Fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon. My friends from school and I came together and wanted to re charter this fraternity at Syracuse University. 
                It was a long and rigorous process to get the school on board with the whole thing, but we managed to get it done. We were all initiated into the fraternity in Feb. 2024. 
                We are considered the founding fathers of this Fraternity at Syracuse. It makes it a lot more meaningful to be in a fraternity when you create it instead of join it. 
                I'm proud of myself and the executive board for how much work and dedication that's been put into this process. It's only up from here.

                I have a lot of hobbies. Now that I am at Syracuse the most prevelant ones are:
